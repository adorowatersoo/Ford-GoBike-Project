# Project Ford GoBike System Data, Dataset Exploration
## by Tersoo Adorowa


## Dataset

> The main objective is to Communicate Data Findings from a dataset from Ford GoBike System Data.
> For safety and to enable bi- and multivariate exploration I removed the outliers. I created new colunms like the Member age and the age groups and corrected some data_types.


## Summary of Findings

> The number of trips at the start of the trips is the same that at the end of trips, considering the top five stations. Therefore, it seems that the users use the bike regularly when leaving and returning. It could be interesting to check if they also go to the same route every trip.

> Regarding the users and trips, men and people between 18 and 39 years old are a majority on trips. Subscribers are also a majority in the trips. I will show this in my explanatory presentation 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The older the members who share bikes for the entire trip, the longer the trip. Subscriber users are older than the customers. The correlation between member age and duration_sec does not present any interesting result. The duration of trips by younger people is more stable than the older, these have higher variation
